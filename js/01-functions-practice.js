/*Practice with Functions (5 points)
1.	Write a function called halfNumber() that accepts one argument (a number), divide it by 2, and return the result. It should log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".
2.	Write a function called squareNumber() that accepts one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."
3.	Write a function called percentOf() that accepts two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."
4.	Write a function called findModulus() that accepts two numbers. Within the function write a statement that returns the modulus of the first and second parameters. It should log a string like "2 is the modulus of 4 and 10."
5.	Create a JavaScript function that accepts a certain amount of numbers as parameters. Those numbers should be collected using a prompt and the numbers should be delimited by commas. Once the values are collected, find the sum of all of the numbers combined. You will need to use a function, loop, arguments object, and several type conversion global functions to accomplish this task.*/



//STEP 1

/*function halfNumber(number) {
    "use strict";

    result = number / 2;
    return result;
}
var number = 5;

//STEP 2
/*Write a function called squareNumber() that accepts one argument (a number), square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."*/

/*function squareNumber(number) {

    return result;
}
var number = 5;
var result = squareNumber(number);

//STEP 3
/*Write a function called percentOf() that accepts two numbers, figure out what percent the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."*/

/*function percentOf(number1, number2) {

}
var number1 = 2;
var number2 = 4;
var result = percentOf(number1, number2);

//STEP 4
/*Write a function called findModulus() that accepts two numbers. Within the function write a statement that returns the modulus of the first and second parameters. It should log a string like "2 is the modulus of 4 and 10."*/

/*function findModulus(number1, number2) {

    result = number1 % number2;
    return result;
}
var number1 = 12
var number2 = 5;
var result = findModulus(number1, number2);
window.console.log(result + " is the modulus of " + number1 + " and " + number2 + ".");*/
